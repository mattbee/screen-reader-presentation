<h1>Screenreader Users</h1>

<p>Screen readers are hard to use. As with all technology, the more time you invest in them, the better you get at using them.</p>
<p>If you're visually impaired, you tend not to have much of a choice if you want to use a computer,
so they often become power users.</p>
<p>Power users are so efficient and knowledgable about how to use a screenreader, they
use them in very different ways to a sighted person, like Matt here, <span class="visually-hidden">Hey. Matt, put your phone down and pay attention, sorry about that, anyway, like I was saying, screen reader users usually differ to the rude Matt,</span> who is just trying to feel his way through to ensure our site works
with assistive technology.</p>
