<h1>The challenge</h1>

<p>I have 6 tasks for you to complete using a screen reader only. I created a website that comes with a button to let you hide the screen and show help using VoiceOver. <span class="visually-hidden">My glamorous assistant Matt will demo that after my presesntation</span>.</p>
<p>Screen reader users also rarely use a mouse. So keyboard use only please. If you can find the answers without seeing the screen, all the better, but to practice you might just have use your eyes to figure out what is happening.</p>
<p>Basically, if you can get VoiceOver to read the answer to you, you can call that task 'done'.</p>

<h2>Your tasks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What is the address of Screen Read?</li>
  <li>What is the first heading level 4 item on the 'Advice' page?
    (tip - use the Rotor tool)</li>
  <li>What animal is featured on the thank you page after fake purchasing the book "Accessi-bee-lity"?
  Use the card number 1234 9876 4422 6655 (this is on the worksheet too)</li>
  <li>The third section on the advice page recommends which FutureLearn course?</li>
  <li>What are the opening hours of 'Screen read'?</li>
  <li>How many links and headings are on the advice page? (tip - VoiceOver page summary)</li>
</ol>
