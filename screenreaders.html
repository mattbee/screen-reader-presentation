<h1>Screen readers</h1>

<p>A screen reader is a piece of assistive technology that a visually impaired user might use to
allow them to use a computer, despite not being able to see the interface.</p>

<p>Most screenreaders are not restricted to web browsers. They are used for all programs on a computer of visually impaired users. For example using Email or Skype by blind users is made possible with a screenreader.</p>
