<h1>Setting up your machine</h1>

<p>Chrome or Firefox should work with Voiceover, but the recommended browser for VoiceOver is Safari, so this might be best to use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Safari Macs do not come pre configured for using keyboard navigation so to allow that, change the settings below (or ask for help).</p>
<div class="columns">
  <div class="column">
    <p>In Safari you will need to allow Tab to highlight each item on a webpage.</p>
    <p>Go to Preferences, then Advanced, then hit the checkbox that says "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage"</p>

  <div class="column">
    <p>In your System Preferences you will need to allow the keyboard full access to navigate by keyboard.</p>
    <p>Go to System Preferences, then Keyboard and turn on "Keyboard navigation".</p>
