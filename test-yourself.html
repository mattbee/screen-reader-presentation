<h1>Test yourself more</h1>

<p>Using a screen reader is much easier when you can see.</p>

<p>So if you find yourself cheating, then try these things to make it all harder.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep the VoiceOver help on the website open while you browse the site (it will stay open while you browse and you can browse with the site in the background</li>
  <li>Turn your screen brightness down to 0% or 5% to make it hard to see what you're doing</li>
  <li>Place a piece of A4 over your screen to minimise your cheating</li>
  <li>Fashion a blindfold from anything you can find</li>
  <li>Change VoiceOver settings to use a faster Voice. Blind users will often use a very very fast voice!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Thanks for listening  - now for a demo and the challenges!</h2>
